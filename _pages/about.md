I’m currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science advised by [Prof. Jianbin Jiao](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~jiaojianbin), at [Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Development Laboratory](http://lamp.ucas.ac.cn/), [School of Emergency Management Science and Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://emse.ucas.edu.cn/index.php/zh). My research interests include Reinforcement Learning, Multi-agent Learning, and Large Language Model (LLM) Agents. I am looking for cooperation opportunities. If you are interested with my experience or research, please feel free to contact me via Email.
